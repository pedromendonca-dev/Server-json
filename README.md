Starting studies with HTTP requests

Getting started:

// to enter the directory
`cd httpreact`

// to start the server
`npm run server`

// Open another terminal so you can use

`cd httpreact` 

//and after that 
`npm start` 

to start React, but the localhost will be localhost:3001 because the server is already running on localhost:3000
